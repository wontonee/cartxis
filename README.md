#### 🗑️ Google Play / App Store — Account Deletion URL

Google Play Store (and Apple App Store) require apps that support account creation to provide a **publicly accessible account deletion page** as part of their Data Safety policy.

Cartxis includes this page out of the box. When submitting your app, use the following URL pattern:

```
https://yourdomain.com/account-deletion
```

**Example:** `https://shop.example.com/account-deletion`

This page:
- Is publicly accessible (no login required)
- Explains step-by-step how users can delete their account from within the app
- Lists what data is permanently deleted (profile, addresses, wishlist, cart, tokens)
- Discloses what is retained (anonymized order records for accounting, 7-year minimum)
- Provides an email contact (`dev@wontonee.com`) for users who cannot log in

In the **Google Play Console → App content → Data safety**, paste this URL in the **"Delete account URL"** field.

### 🔧 Technical Features
- **Modular Architecture** — Package-based structure for easy extension
- **MySQL 8.0+** — Optimised relational database layer
- **Modern Frontend** — Vue 3 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Inertia.js** — SPA-like experience without API complexity

- **Email Verification** — Built-in email verification workflow
- **Fortify Integration** — Laravel Fortify for authentication

## 🚀 Quick Install via Composer

The fastest way to get Cartxis running:

```bash
composer create-project cartxis/cartxis my-store
cd my-store
php artisan cartxis:install
```

The interactive installer will guide you through:
- Database configuration (with live connection test)
- Admin account creation (name, email, and password)
- Migrations and seeders
- Building frontend assets automatically

Once complete, the installer displays your admin panel URL, email, and password.

> **If you see blank pages or asset errors after the setup wizard**, the frontend build may not have completed yet. Fix it by running:
> ```bash
> npm run build
> # or if you use Yarn:
> yarn build
> ```

## 🖌️ Visual Page Builder (UI Editor)

Cartxis ships with a powerful visual drag-and-drop page builder that lets you design storefront pages and reusable regions without writing code.

### Pages

Manage CMS pages and your store's homepage through a full visual editing workflow:

- **Create** — Start from a blank canvas or insert saved block templates
- **Edit** — Drag and drop sections, columns, and blocks to build layouts
- **Draft / Publish** — Changes stay in draft until explicitly published; auto-saves every 3 seconds
- **Unpublish** — Revert any page to draft, removing it from the live storefront instantly
- **Live Preview** — Preview pages at Desktop (full width), Tablet (768 px), and Mobile (390 px) breakpoints inside a real theme iframe

### Layout Hierarchy

Layouts are a three-level tree stored as JSON:

```
Page → Sections → Columns → Blocks
```

- **Sections** — Full-width rows with configurable background colour, padding, and full-width toggle
- **Columns** — Responsive 12-column grid; presets: 1, 2, 3, 4 columns · 2/3+1/3 · 1/3+2/3
- **Blocks** — Content units dropped into columns; each block type has its own settings panel

### 32 Built-in Block Types

| Category | Block Types |
|----------|-------------|
| Layout | `spacer`, `divider` |
| Text & Content | `heading`, `text`, `image`, `button`, `video`, `form`, `table`, `card`, `html`, `code`, `accordion`, `tabs`, `icon_box`, `counter`, `social_links`, `author_card`, `share_buttons` |
| Commerce | `hero`, `slider`, `products_grid`, `categories_grid`, `newsletter`, `pricing`, `testimonials` |
| Blog | `post_featured`, `post_list`, `post_carousel`, `blog_posts_grid` |
| Regions | `global_region` |

### Global Regions

Create reusable layout areas (header, footer, sidebar, banner, section) that are embedded into any page via the `global_region` block. Updating a global region propagates instantly to every page that references it.

**Default seeded regions:** Main Header and Main Footer.

### Saved (Reusable) Blocks

Save any section or individual block as a reusable template. Saved blocks appear in the block palette under the **Saved** tab and can be inserted into any page — ideal for promotional banners, CTA strips, or complex product grids you want to maintain consistently.

### Theme Integration

The `UIBlockRenderer` Vue component is shared across all themes. When a published layout exists for a page, it is rendered visually via the block renderer; if no published layout exists the platform falls back gracefully to raw HTML, preserving backward compatibility.

---

## 🎨 Theme Development

The default theme is located in `themes/cartxis-default/`.

### Creating a Custom Theme

```bash
cp -r themes/cartxis-default themes/your-theme-name
```

Update `config/theme.php`:
```php
'active' => 'your-theme-name',
```

Customise:
- **Pages**: `themes/your-theme-name/resources/views/pages/`
- **Components**: `themes/your-theme-name/resources/views/components/`
- **Layouts**: `themes/your-theme-name/resources/views/layouts/`

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./vendor/bin/pest

# Feature tests only
./vendor/bin/pest tests/Feature

# With coverage
./vendor/bin/pest --coverage
```

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### Production Checklist

1. Set `APP_ENV=production` and `APP_DEBUG=false` in `.env`

3. `npm run build`
4. `php artisan config:cache`
5. `php artisan route:cache`
